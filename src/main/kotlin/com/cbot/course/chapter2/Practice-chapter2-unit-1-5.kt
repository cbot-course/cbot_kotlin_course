# Practice Tasks: Chapter 2: Units 1-5

---

## Unit 1. Functions and Their Parameters

1. Write a function called `greet` that takes a name (String) as a parameter and prints "Hello, [name]!".
2. Write a function called `displayUser` that takes two parameters: a name (String) and an age (Int), and prints "Name: [name], Age: [age]".
3. Write a function called `showMessage` that takes a message (String) and prints it. Try calling it with different messages.

*/

fun greet(name: String) {
    println("Hello, $name!")
}

fun displayUser(name: String, age: Int) {
    println("Name: $name, Age: $age")
}

fun showMessage(message: String) {
    println(message)
}


/*
## Unit 2. Vararg Parameters

1. Write a function called `printNumbers` that takes a variable number of integers and prints each one on a new line.
2. Write a function called `concatStrings` that takes a variable number of strings and prints them as a single line separated by spaces.
3. Write a function called `addToGroup` that takes a group name (String), any number of user names (String), and prints the group name and all users.

---

## Unit 3. Returning Results

1. Write a function called `multiply` that takes two Int parameters and returns their product.
2. Write a function called `isEven` that takes an Int and returns true if the number is even, false otherwise.
3. Write a function called `printIfPositive` that takes an Int and prints the number only if it is positive (use `return` to exit early).

---

## Unit 4. Single-Expression and Local Functions

1. Write a single-expression function called `cube` that returns the cube of a given Int.
2. Write a function called `checkAndPrint` that takes an Int, defines a local function `isValid` to check if the number is positive, and prints "Valid" or "Invalid".
3. Write a function `compare` that takes two Ints and a local function that returns true if both are less than 10. Print "Both less than 10" or "Not both less than 10".

---

## Unit 5. Function Overloading

1. Write two functions with the same name `show` â€” one that takes a String and prints it, another that takes an Int and prints it.
2. Write two functions called `max`: one that takes two Ints and returns the larger, another that takes two Doubles and returns the larger.
3. Write two functions named `sum`: one that takes two Ints, and one that takes three Ints, and both return the sum.
