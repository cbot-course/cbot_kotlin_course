package main.kotlin.com.cbot.course.practice_unit_4_7/*# Practice: Kotlin Basics

Try these simple tasks to practice the main topics from our lessons:
**if/else, when, loops, ranges, arrays**.

---

## 1. Conditional Statements (`if/else`)

**Task 1:**
Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
Print a message for each case.

```kotlin
val number = -3
```

**Task 2:**
Check if a number is even or odd. Print the result.

```kotlin
val number = 7
```

---

## 2. `when` Expression

**Task 1:**
Write a program that takes a variable `grade` (Int) from 1 to 5 and prints:
- "Excellent" for 5
- "Good" for 4
- "Okay" for 3
- "Bad" for 2
- "Terrible" for 1

```kotlin
val grade = 4
```

**Task 2:**
Take a variable `month` (Int) from 1 to 12 and print the season ("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn").
Use `when` and ranges.

```kotlin
val month = 7
```

---

## 3. Loops and `for` Loops

**Task 1:**
Print all numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

```kotlin
```

**Task 2:**
Print the multiplication table for 5 (from 1 to 10), like:
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50
```

```kotlin
```

---

## 4. Ranges

**Task 1:**
Print all even numbers from 2 to 20 using a range and a loop.

```kotlin
```

**Task 2:**
Print numbers from 10 down to 1 using a reversed range.

```kotlin
```

---

## 5. Arrays

**Task 1:**
Create an array of names (`"Tom"`, `"Sam"`, `"Bob"`).
Print each name on a new line using a loop.

```kotlin
```

**Task 2:**
Create an array of 5 numbers.
Print the sum of all numbers in the array.

```kotlin
```
